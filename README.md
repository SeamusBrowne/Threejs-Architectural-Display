The main purpose of the project is to visualise the density and proximity of existing structures adjacent to the target building. Showing the height of topography in the surrounding landscape. Furthermore, using labels to easily identify landmarks to convey the location of the building in question.
In this example, it shows Cork County Council, Ireland as our main building and focal point.

Software uses three.js, JavaScript, GIS, css and html.
